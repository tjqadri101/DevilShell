DevilShell
==========
My partner (Negatu Asmamaw) and I implemented a shell command interpreter for an assignment for my course CS 310: Operating Systems at Duke University. If you are taking that course, please do not view the code. Please do not copy or use this code for any graded work.

The requirements for this assignment can be viewed in the lab2.pdf file which is present in the lab2 folder of this repository. We have also added, in the lab2 folder, the Readme document that I submitted for this assignment. Our code is present in dsh.c file in the lab2 folder.
